The purpose of CTGP-R Ghost Downloader is to be able to view rankings and download all of the Mario Kart WII world records from the CTGP leaderboards. Ghosts that will be downloaded include all original tracks at 150cc and 200cc, as well as CTGP custom tracks at 150cc and 200cc. 

This program also downloads time trial cards which show the track name, ghost's time, the character and vehicle they used to achieve this time, and some basic player information (An example of this can be found below). All download progress is updated in real time using a loading bar to keep you up-to-date, as downloading all ghosts may take a while. More information can be found below.
